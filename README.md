# Original CPython HTTP Implementation

This repository is a **copy** of CPython's HTTP module @ v3.90 and related tests.
Original files may be found [here](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/v3.9.0/Lib/http).

The purpose of this project is to ease tinkering with the HTTP module without
having to deal with a full-fledged clone of CPython itself. Please notice that
this copying-and-pasting has its limits. Changes made here need to be validated
against a real cpython clone before being submited to cpython core.
